# GPSReader-gps2gpx-py
Little Python script for translate GPS .txt files from GPSReader.exe to GPX format.

I made this script originally because i've try to upload a 360 video taken with a Insta360 camera to Mapillary. That camera comes with a stitcher, who export a 360 video, that vide can be uploaded to Mapillary, but Mapillarye requests for a separated GPX track file when a video is uploaded. Insta360 stitcher comes with a tool called "GPSReader.exe" which dumps the track of camera record with info like WGS84 coordinates, elevation, datetime, etc; in a txt file with JSON format.
